So the test cycle will be: having all the front end presented (I have checked and it is ok) -> then check each agent page function  (python) with scirpt to check (check with OpenAI API: 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 ) if possible provided with additional providers - gemini and openrouter (but you must check with context7 MCP, and use internet for browsing the accurate uses and document) - then check integration with front end - document test case on proper directories where you place your script -> making pull request as a cycle finish
