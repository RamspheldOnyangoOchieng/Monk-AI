# Monk-AI Hackathon Setup

## Notes
- User currently on Windows using Python **3.12** (Microsoft Store build).
- Several dependencies lack pre-built wheels for 3.13:
  - `pydantic 2.x` required Rust → fixed by downgrading to `<2`.
  - `aiohttp 3.9.1` requires MSVC compiler when wheel absent.
- Updated `requirements.txt` line 4 to `pydantic<2`.
- Dependency installation incomplete; `pip freeze` shows only uvicorn dependencies. Purged pip cache and running verbose reinstall (`pip install -vvv`) to diagnose.
- Bash on Windows interprets back-slashes as escapes; use forward slashes in commands (e.g., `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe`).
- User opted to switch to Python **3.12** for compatibility and speed.
- Python **3.12.10** venv created and active.
- `uvicorn` initially missing; installed manually (`pip install uvicorn==0.24.0`).
- FastAPI server start failed due to `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`; update uvicorn module path (`Monk-AI-main.app.main:app`) or run from correct directory.
- Second attempt failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`; environment showed only partial packages.
- Initial `requirements.txt` install targeted wrong path; re-running pip install inside project root to populate venv correctly.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` still not populating env; manual `pip install fastapi==0.104.1` initiated — root cause under investigation.
- Manual installs: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `openai`, `anthropic`, etc.) now present; `aiohttp` still missing.
- FastAPI server now starts successfully using uvicorn; `aiohttp` appears non-critical for startup.
- `curl` test to `/api/generate-project-scope` failed; server unreachable—need to inspect uvicorn logs and ensure it stays running.
- Foreground run revealed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agents'`; server exits immediately—need to fix package imports or PYTHONPATH.
- Updated `app/main.py` to use relative imports for agent modules, error resolved.
- Foreground server run now fails with `NameError: name 'List'` in `doc_generator.py`; missing `from typing import List, Dict`.
- Added missing `from typing import List, Dict` to `doc_generator.py`, resolving `NameError`.
- Fixed regex escaping in `test_generator.py`, resolving `SyntaxError`; attempting to restart server.
- FastAPI server now running and accessible at http://localhost:8000; interactive docs reachable.
- Frontend `package.json` lacks a `dev` script; `npm start` exists (react-scripts). Need to add `dev` alias or document usage.
- Sample endpoint `/api/generate-project-scope` tested successfully; returns expected project scope.
- PR review endpoint requires `pr_url` and `repository`; gather payload schemas for all endpoints.
- User requested full showcase covering all 11 tabs; need to test every agent endpoint and prepare frontend demo script.
- All endpoints currently require valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; set env vars or mock for demo.
- React frontend with complete pages (`src/pages`) confirmed present.
- Added animation packages (`framer-motion`, `react-syntax-highlighter`) to frontend and `npm install` completed successfully after removing `react-diff-viewer` conflict.
- Enhanced `CodeOptimizer` agent with complexity analysis, metrics, and performance projections.
- Enhanced `Dashboard.tsx` with framer-motion animations, metrics, and polished UI.
- Comprehensive hackathon showcase script drafted (demo flow & talking points).
- Frontend navigation and component structure confirmed.
- Enhanced `SecurityAnalyzer` with OWASP Top 10 categorization, risk scoring, and static analysis; fixed f-string issue.
- Fixed residual syntax error in `security_analyzer.py` causing server crash.
- Enhanced `PRReviewer` with complexity scoring, impact assessment, and advanced review metrics.
- Enhanced `TestGenerator` with coverage estimation, quality metrics, and strategy recommendations.
- `.venv` folder inside project root currently missing; `uvicorn` not found when running via global Python.
- Need to recreate/activate project-local virtual environment and reinstall dependencies to restore server functionality.
- New `.venv` created, but `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails again building `aiohttp`; requires MSVC build tools—need workaround (pin older wheel or install build tools).
- Manually installed essential packages (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `openai`, `anthropic`, etc.) in `.venv`; server starts but `agents/pr_reviewer.py` import error (`import requests`).
- User asked how to push local modifications and open a pull request to the original repository (`RamspheldOnyangoOchieng/Monk-AI`).
- Provided detailed git workflow instructions (feature branch, push, PR) to upstream repo.
- User wants to re-test backend endpoints and frontend before opening the PR.
- `requests` package confirmed installed; PR reviewer import error likely due to a typo in the import statement.
- Latest attempt to start FastAPI with `uvicorn --reload` exited with code **130** (likely interrupted); need stable server run before testing.
- `/health` endpoint not implemented; confirm server via actual agent endpoints.
- Server reachable but `/api/analyze-security` currently failing (JSON decode / 500); need correct payload escaping and potential endpoint bug fix.
- `/api/generate-tests` endpoint reachable but returns "api_key client option must be set"—need `OPENAI_API_KEY` env or mock.
- `/api/review-pr` endpoint similarly reachable but returns "api_key client option must be set"—confirms endpoint functionality; requires API keys.
- FastAPI server now running and accessible at http://localhost:8000; interactive docs reachable.
- Git working tree currently clean; ensure all enhancements are saved, staged, and committed before creating the PR.
- User reports commits already exist locally and now needs to push them and open a PR to the upstream repository.
- Feature branch `feature/hackathon-enhancements` created and pushed to fork (`mbpfws/Monk-AI-main`).
- PR creation page opened; awaiting user submission to finalize PR.
